# 🔐 File Encrypt & Decrypt in Java  
### 👨‍💻 Created by: Vineet Khatri

This is a **console-based Java project** that demonstrates basic file encryption and decryption logic.

---

## 🧩 Features

- Encrypts the content of a file using basic encryption logic
- Decrypts it back to the original form using the same key
- Simple demonstration of symmetric encryption

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User selects a file and provides an encryption key (integer).
2. The program reads the file byte-by-byte and applies encrypt operation using the key.
3. Running the program again with the same file and key decrypts it back.
