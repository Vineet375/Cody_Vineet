# 🔐 Password Utility Tool in Java  
## 👨‍💻 Developed by: Vineet Khatri

This Java console-based application combines two essential password utilities:

1. ✅ Random Password Generator  
2. ✅ Password Strength Checker

The final program offers:
- Strong password generation with random characters (letters, digits, symbols)
- User-input-based strength checking (based on length, characters, and variety)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- The user is prompted to either:
  - Generate a random password
  - Check the strength of an entered password
- The tool then executes the selected function and displays the results in the console
